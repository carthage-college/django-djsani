                I acknowledge that I have to be an active participant in my
                own healthcare.  As such, I have the direct responsibility
                for reporting all of my injuries and illnesses to the sports
                medicine staff of my institution (e.g., team physician,
                athletic training staff).  I recognize that my true physical
                condition is dependent upon an accurate medical history and a
                full disclosure of any symptoms, complaints, prior injuries
                and/or disabilities experienced.  I hereby affirm that I have
                fully disclosed in writing any prior medical conditions and
                will also disclose any future conditions to the sports
                medicine staff at my institution.
            </p><p>
                I further understand that there is a possibility that
                participation in my sport may result in a head injury and/or
                concussion.  I have been provided with education on head
                injuries and understand the importance of immediately
                reporting symptoms of a head injury/concussion to my sports
                medicine staff.
            </p><p>
                By checking the box below, I acknowledge that my institution
                has provided me with specific educational materials on what
                a concussion is and given me an opportunity to ask questions
                about areas and issues that are not clear to me on this issue.
