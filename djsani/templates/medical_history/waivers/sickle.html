                <h3>About Sickle Cell Trait</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait is an inherited condition of the
                        oxygen-carrying protein, hemoglobin, in the red blood
                        cells
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait is a common condition (more than
                       three million Americans)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although sickle cell trait is most predominant in
                        African-Americans and those of Mediterranean, Middle
                        Eastern, Indian, Caribbean, and South and Central
                        American ancestry, persons of all races and
                        ancestry may test positive for sickle cell trait.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait has been associated with a condition
                        known as exertional rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and
                        death. Complicating factors include extreme exertion,
                        increased heat, altitude and dehydration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait is usually benign, but during
                        intense, sustained exercise, hypoxia (lack of oxygen)
                        in the muscles may cause sickling of red blood cells
                        (red blood cells changing from a normal disc shape to
                        a crescent or "sickle" shape), which can accumulate in
                        the bloodstream and "logjam" blood vessels, leading to
                        a collapse from the rapid breakdown of muscle starved
                        of blood.

                </ul>
                <h3>Sickle Cell trait Testing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The NCAA recommends that all NCAA Division III
                        student-athletes have knowledge of their sickle cell
                        trait status
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Carthage College recommends that all student-athletes
                        who are unable to confirm their sickle cell trait
                        status undergo sickle cell trait testing prior to
                        participation in any intercollegiate athlete activity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait testing in the form of a blood test
                        can be done by the student-athlete's personal primary
                        care physician or by the United Hospital Kenosha Campus
                        Laboratory.  Testing generally costs between $25-75
                        depending on the testing site. THIS EXPENSE IS THE
                        RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STUDENT-ATHLETE.

                <h3>Test Results or Sickle Cell Trait Testing Waiver</h3>
                <p>
                    After reviewing the above information and the NCAA
                    Fact Sheet for Student-Athletes I have elected to:
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will provide documented proof of my Sickle Cell Trait
                    status from previous testing to the athletic training
                    staff (as well as answer below):
                </p>
                <p>
                    Test Results:   Positive   Negative
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand and acknowledge that the NCAA and
                    Carthage College Department of Athletics recommends that
                    all student-athletes have knowledge of their sickle cell
                    trait status. Additionally, I have read and fully
                    understand the aforementioned facts about sickle cell
                    trait testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing that my true physical condition is dependent
                    upon an accurate medical history and a full disclosure
                    of any symptoms, complaints, prior injuries, ailments
                    and/or disabilities experienced, I hereby affirm that I
                    have fully disclosed in writing any prior medical history
                    and/or knowledge of sickle cell trait status to the
                    Carthage College Athletic Training Staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not wish to undergo sickle cell trait testing and I
                    voluntarily agree to release, discharge, indemnify, and
                    hold harmless Carthage College, its officers, employees,
                    and agents from any and all costs, liabilities, expenses,
                    claims demands, or causes of action on account of any
                    loss or personal injury that might result from my
                    non-compliance with the recommendation of the NCAA and
                    the Carthage College Department of Athletics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have read this document with full knowledge
                    of its significance. I further state that I am at least
                    18 years of age and competent to sign this waiver.
                </p>
