                Carthage College would like to inform you of two potentially
                serious diseases with special
                implications for college students, and inform you that
                vaccines are available to prevent them.
            </p><p>
                Studies have shown that college students are at an increased
                risk of infection from meningitis and
                hepatitis B. Meningitis is an infection that can lead to
                dangerous swelling of the fluid surrounding
                the brain and spinal cord, as well as severe and permanent
                disabilities. This is a rare, but
                potentially fatal infection that often begins with symptoms
                that resemble the flu. Symptoms can
                include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, rash, nausea,
                vomiting, lethargy, and confusion.
                Meningitis is spread through the air via respiratory
                secretions or close contact with an infected
                person. This can include coughing, sneezing, kissing or
                sharing items like utensils, cigarettes,
                and drinking glasses. However, meningitis can be prevented
                with safe and effective vaccines.
            </p><p>
                The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College
                Health Association (ACHA) has 
                recommended that all first-year college students living in
                residence halls should be immunized
                against meningococcal disease with the meningococcal conjugate
                vaccine (MCV4). In addition,
                the CDC has further recommended that a booster vaccine be
                given if the first vaccine was
                received before age 16. Other college students under 22 years
                of age who wish to reduce their
                risk for disease may also choose to be vaccinated. The MCV4
                vaccine protects against four of the
                five types of bacteria that cause meningitisâ€”Types A, C, Y and
                W-135. These four types account
                for nearly two-thirds of the meningitis cases among college
                students in the United States. The
                MCV4 vaccine is believed to be 85 to 100 percent effective at
                preventing infection from Types A,
                C, Y, and W-135. The vaccine does not protect against
                serogroup B meningococcal disease. If
                you are interested in receiving the meningitis vaccine,
                please contact your healthcare provider to
                discuss risks and benefits, and determine if the vaccine is
                right for you.

                Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that
                attacks the liver. Symptoms can include
                fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and yellowing of the skin.
                These symptoms can last for several
                weeks, but hepatitis B can also cause a long-term illness
                that may lead to scarring of the liver,
                liver cancer, liver failure, or death. Each year 80,000
                people get infected with hepatitis B, mostly
                young people. Hepatitis B is spread through contact with
                blood or other body fluids of an infected person. You can
                catch the virus by having unprotected sex, sharing drug
                needles, or by sharing personal items like razors and
                toothbrushes with someone who is infected. Vaccination is
                recommended for everyone age 18 or younger. Most incoming
                college students will have already
                had the vaccine series in childhood. The hepatitis B vaccine
                is 95 percent effective in preventing
                infection and its chronic consequences. If you have not been
                vaccinated against hepatitis B and are interested in
                receiving the vaccination series, please contact your
                healthcare provider to discuss the risks and benefits,
                and determine if the vaccine is right for you. Three doses
                of the vaccine are needed for complete protection.

                Wisconsin State Public Health Law, Act 61 requires all
                colleges and universities in Wisconsin to
                annually inform students about the risks associated
                with meningococcal disease and hepatitis B,
                and the availability and effectiveness of vaccines
                against the diseases.
            </p><p>
                These vaccinations are not mandatory, but are recommended.
                You can receive these
                vaccinations through your local public health agency or
                through your private physician. If you have questions
