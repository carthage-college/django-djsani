                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait is an inherited condition of the
                        oxygen-carrying protein, hemoglobin, in the red blood
                        cells
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait is a common condition (more than
                       three million Americans)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although sickle cell trait is most predominant in
                        African-Americans and those of Mediterranean, Middle
                        Eastern, Indian, Caribbean, and South and Central
                        American ancestry, persons of all races and
                        ancestry may test positive for sickle cell trait.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait has been associated with a condition
                        known as exertional rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and
                        death. Complicating factors include extreme exertion,
                        increased heat, altitude and dehydration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait is usually benign, but during
                        intense, sustained exercise, hypoxia (lack of oxygen)
                        in the muscles may cause sickling of red blood cells
                        (red blood cells changing from a normal disc shape to
                        a crescent or "sickle" shape), which can accumulate in
                        the bloodstream and "logjam" blood vessels, leading to
                        a collapse from the rapid breakdown of muscle starved
                        of blood.

                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>
                        The NCAA recommends that all NCAA Division III
                        student-athletes have knowledge of their sickle cell
                        trait status
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Carthage College recommends that all student-athletes
                        who are unable to confirm their sickle cell trait
                        status undergo sickle cell trait testing prior to
                        participation in any intercollegiate athlete activity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sickle cell trait testing in the form of a blood test
                        can be done by the student-athlete's personal primary
                        care physician or by the United Hospital Kenosha Campus
                        Laboratory.  Testing generally costs between $25-75
                        depending on the testing site. THIS EXPENSE IS THE
                        RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STUDENT-ATHLETE.
