        <h3>About Sickle Cell Trait</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
                Sickle cell trait is an inherited condition of the
                oxygen-carrying protein, hemoglobin, in the red blood
                cells
            </li>
            <li>
                Sickle cell trait is a common condition (more than
               three million Americans)
            </li>
            <li>
                Although sickle cell trait is most predominant in
                African-Americans and those of Mediterranean, Middle
                Eastern, Indian, Caribbean, and South and Central
                American ancestry, persons of all races and
                ancestry may test positive for sickle cell trait.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sickle cell trait has been associated with a condition
                known as exertional rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and
                death. Complicating factors include extreme exertion,
                increased heat, altitude and dehydration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sickle cell trait is usually benign, but during
                intense, sustained exercise, hypoxia (lack of oxygen)
                in the muscles may cause sickling of red blood cells
                (red blood cells changing from a normal disc shape to
                a crescent or "sickle" shape), which can accumulate in
                the bloodstream and "logjam" blood vessels, leading to
                a collapse from the rapid breakdown of muscle starved
                of blood.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sickle Cell trait Testing</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
                The NCAA recommends that all NCAA Division III
                student-athletes have knowledge of their sickle cell
                trait status
            </li>
            <li>
                Carthage College recommends that all student-athletes
                who are unable to confirm their sickle cell trait
                status undergo sickle cell trait testing prior to
                participation in any intercollegiate athlete activity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sickle cell trait testing in the form of a blood test
                can be done by the student-athlete's personal primary
                care physician or by the United Hospital Kenosha Campus
                Laboratory.  Testing generally costs between $25-75
                depending on the testing site. THIS EXPENSE IS THE
                RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STUDENT-ATHLETE.

            I understand and acknowledge that the NCAA and
            Carthage College Department of Athletics recommends that
            all student-athletes have knowledge of their sickle cell
            trait status. Additionally, I have read and fully
            understand the aforementioned facts about sickle cell
            trait testing.

            Recognizing that my true physical condition is dependent
            upon an accurate medical history and a full disclosure
            of any symptoms, complaints, prior injuries, ailments
            and/or disabilities experienced, I hereby affirm that I
            have fully disclosed in writing any prior medical history

            Carthage College Athletic Training Staff.

            I do not wish to undergo sickle cell trait testing and I
